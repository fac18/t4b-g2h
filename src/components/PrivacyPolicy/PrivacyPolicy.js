      <h3>5. YOUR RIGHTS AND OUR OBLIGATIONS</h3>
      <p>Consent:</p>
      <p>
        We will generally process personal data on the basis of having specific
        consent to do so for that specific purpose. If we require your consent,
        we will explicitly ask for such consent at the time of collecting your
        personal data.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, we may also process your personal information if we are able to
        do so without explicit consent under the Act and/or Regulation. For
        example, we may be able to legally control and process your personal
        information without your consent if it is necessary in order for us to
        provide the service you have asked to, or if we have a legitimate
        interest in doing so, or if doing so is in the public interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also process your personal information without your consent if we
        have a legitimate interest in doing so, for example, for some internal
        administrative purposes, or for the purpose of ensuring electronic
        information security.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we are controlling and processing your personal information on the
        sole basis of having your consent to do so, we must gain separate
        consents from you in respect of each distinct processing operation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where we are processing your personal information on the basis of you
        having given us your consent to do so, you do have the right to withdraw
        that consent at any time, but this will not affect the lawfulness of
        processing prior to the withdrawal of such consent. You can exercise
        your right to withdraw consent to processing at any time by contacting
        us via email to info@andreastern.co.uk.
      </p>
      <p>Rectification and Erasure:</p>

        You benefit from the right to rectify inaccurate personal information we
        hold which relates to you &#40;also known as the “right to rectification”&#41;.
        This means that, taking into account the subject of the processing, you
        shall have the right to have incomplete personal information completed.
        You can exercise your right to rectification by contacting us via

        such data without undue delay, provided that you are able to demonstrate
        one of the following to us:
      </p>
      <p>
        &#40;a&#41; that our processing of the personal information is no longer
        necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was collected;
      </p>
      <p>
        &#40;b&#41; that you withdraw your consent to the processing and there is no
        other legal ground for us to continue to process the data;
      </p>
      <p>
        &#40;c&#41; that you object to the processing under regulation 21 of the
        Regulation and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for
        processing;
      </p>
      <p>
        &#40;d&#41; that the personal information must be erased in order to comply with
        a national legal obligation; or

        the right to transmit such data to other data controllers without
        hindrance from us where we are processing that data on the basis of
        having your consent to do so, or where it is necessary for the
        performance of a contract, and the processing is carried out by
        automated means.
