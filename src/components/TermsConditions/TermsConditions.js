      <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
      
        <h3>1. Interpretation</h3>
        <p>
        1.1 These Conditions together with the Licence
        Confirmation constitute an agreement ("the Agreement") between the
        British Museum Company Limited ("BMCo") and the person identified in the
        Licence Confirmation ("Licensee"). All licences and permissions in the
        Agreement are conditional upon Licensee complying with the terms of the
        Agreement. Reproducing any photographs or other copyright work(s) in
        breach of or outside the scope of the Agreement is an infringement of
        copyright. 1.2 If there is any manifest conflict between the provisions
        of the Licence Confirmation and those of these Conditions then the
        provisions of the Licence Confirmation shall prevail. The Agreement
        shall prevail over any terms which Licensee may purport to apply (e.g.
        by way of a purchase order). 1.3 Unless otherwise stated in the Licence
        Confirmation, Licensee enters into the Agreement as a business rather
        than as a consumer. Please let us know if you are a consumer. 1.4 In the
        Agreement the following terms, unless the context otherwise requires,
        have the following meanings: "the Image" means any and all photographs
        described in the Licence Confirmation together with any accompanying
        caption text and other materials supplied by BMCo; "Licensed Product"
        means (subject to Clause 3.7) the publication or type of product
        (including books, cards, TV programmes and films) which makes use of the
        Image in the way described in the Licence Confirmation. "Licensed
        Territory" means the territory described in the Licence Confirmation.
        1.5 In the Agreement, references to "include" and "including" are to be
        construed without limitation. References to person(s) include
        incorporated and unincorporated bodies or partnerships and include
        reference to that person's successors and permitted assigns. Headings
        are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of the
        Agreement.
