      <h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
      <p>
        This is a legal agreement between you, the client, and us, the image
        supplier. You will be deemed to have accepted all the terms of this
        Agreement in respect of any image you receive or download including
        preview images and thumbnails.

          and conditions, all terms set out in the delivery note and any terms
          set out in the invoice. The terms set out in the delivery note and the

          inconsistency.
        </p>

        <p>
          1.3 “End User”: your customer or client for, and the ultimate user of, the
          Images.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.4 “Image”: any image which has been selected for the purposes of
          licensing reproduction rights.
        </p>
        <p>1.5 “Licence”: the licence set out in clause 4.</p>
        <p>
          1.6 “Licence Fee”: any sum&#40;s&#41; payable by you to us in respect of the
          Licence.
        </p>
        <p>1.7 “we”: the image supplier.</p>
        <p>1.8 “you”: our client.</p>
        <p>
          1.9 References to clauses are to the clauses of these terms and
          conditions.
        </p>
      <h3>3. DIGITAL DELIVERY OF IMAGES</h3>
      <p>
        3.1 This clause 3 applies to Digital Images &#40;including preview images
        and thumbnails&#41; downloaded by you, delivered to you online, or delivered
        to you by email or other purely digital means.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.2 You agree to be bound by all the terms of this Agreement when you
        set up your user account with us and you confirm your acceptance of
        these terms and conditions each time you download any image, whether or
        not you have logged in or set up a user agreement.
      </p>
      <h3>4. GRANT OF LICENCE</h3>
      <p>
        4.1 Subject to the terms of this Agreement, we grant to you a
        non-transferable, non-exclusive &#40;unless otherwise agreed in writing&#41;
        licence, on payment of the Licence Fee, to reproduce the Images during
        the licence period, in the territory and for the purposes specified in
        the delivery note or the invoice.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.2 Use of the Images is strictly limited to the purpose, medium,
        licence period, print run, placement, size of licensed material,
        territory and any other terms agreed. Unless otherwise specified in the
        delivery note or invoice, the Licence is for single use, meaning a
        reproduction in one size for one edition of a single publication in one
        medium only, published in one language only. The licence period
        commences on the date specified on the invoice &#40;or if no date is
        specified, on the date of the invoice itself&#41; and is for the full
        duration specified on the invoice, but the Licence only comes into
        effect on payment in full of the Licence Fee. If the Licence is for
        online use no licence for offline use is implied, and vice versa. For
        example, a licence to reproduce Images in a printed book does not imply
        any licence to reproduce the Images in an e-book. Digital use will be
        treated as a separate use from physical use, requiring payment of an
        additional fee to be agreed in advance.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.3 You may not grant sub-licences of any of the rights included in the
        Licence, or sub-contract any aspects of exploitation of the rights
        licensed to you, without our prior written consent. However, you may
        grant sub-licences to End Users to reproduce the Images on terms that
        prohibit those End Users from granting any further sub-licence and
        require those End Users to comply with all the terms of this Agreement.
        You may also sublicense reproduction rights to printers and other
        production suppliers solely to the extent necessary for production
        purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.4 We reserve all rights in relation to the Images that are not
        expressly granted to you under this Agreement, whether known now, or
        created later, and whether or not in the contemplation of the parties at
        the time of this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.5 We may require you to cease all use of any of the Images if we
        reasonably believe that your use of such Images infringes the
        intellectual property rights of any third party, or breaches any
        applicable law or regulation. In this instance, we may, at our option
        either:
      </p>
      <p>
        &#40;a&#41; provide you with alternative Image&#40;s&#41; so as to avoid the
        infringement; or
      </p>
      <p>
        &#40;b&#41; terminate this Agreement immediately on written notice in respect of
        the relevant Images.
      </p>
      <h3>5. RESTRICTIONS AND OBLIGATIONS</h3>
      <p>
        5.1 You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in
        performing your obligations and exercising your rights under this
        Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.2 You must not incorporate Images &#40;or any part of them&#41; into a logo,
        trade mark or service mark.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.3 Images must not be used as references for creating drawings or other
        visual works unless expressly agreed by us in writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.4 Images must not be used in comps, presentations or layouts, nor may
        Images be used in slide projections or other presentations, unless
        expressly agreed by us in writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.5 Images must not be reproduced more than once within any design,
        editorial piece, advertisement or other work product, unless expressly
        agreed by us in writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.6 A licence to use an Image on or in a product, including a book or
        magazine cover, does not imply any licence on your part to use the Image
        in the advertising or promotion of that product, except as part of an
        image of the product itself showing the Image in its context.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.7 You must not use Images in a pornographic, obscene, defamatory,
        misleading, unlawful or offensive manner, whether directly or in context
        or by juxtaposition with other materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.8 You must comply with any special instructions or restriction on use
        notified to you by us before, after or at the time of delivery of the
        Images, either in the information or metadata accompanying the Images,
        the delivery note, the invoice or by any other means.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.9 Images shall not be altered or manipulated, added to or have any
        part cropped or deleted without our prior written consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.10 The Images must not be made available for use or distribution
        separately or detached from a product or web page. For example, the
        Images may be used as an integral part of a web page design, but may not
        be made available for downloading separately or in a format designed or
        intended for storage or re-use by website users. Similarly, End Users
        may be provided with copies of the Images as an integral part of your
        work product, but must not be provided with the Images or permitted to
        use the Images separately. Images must not be made available on or
        linked to via websites, products or services such as Pixazza, Stipple or
        Clic2c.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.11 Images may not be modified, reconfigured or repurposed for use in
        any mobile-directed web sites or mobile applications that are
        specifically created for viewing of material on mobile devices, without
        our prior written consent which might require payment of an additional
        licence fee. For clarification, this restriction on mobile use is not
        breached if an Image that is licensed for web site use can be viewed via
        mobile devices in a “pull” &#40;as opposed to “push”&#41; fashion, provided it
        is not so specifically modified, reconfigured or repurposed for this
        purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.12 The Images must not, unless expressly agreed by us in writing, be
        posted on social networking or file-sharing sites such as Flickr, Plixi,
        YouTube, Facebook or MySpace.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.13 You acknowledge the original nature of and agree not to challenge
        on the ground of non-originality the subsistence of copyright in Images
        consisting of skilled photographic reproductions of artistic works such
        as paintings, photographs and sculptures.
      </p>
      <h3>6. DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT</h3>
      <p>
        6.1 You acknowledge that the Images are our valuable property, as are
        any Digital Images created from the Images.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.2 You may store the Images in a digital library, network configuration
        or similar arrangement to allow them to be viewed within your
        organisation or within the End User’s organisation for planning or
        production purposes, but you must retain the copyright symbol, our name,
        the Image identification numbers and any other information which may be
        embedded in the electronic files containing the original Images. Please
        note under EU Directive 2001/29/EC it is illegal to remove or alter
        metadata associated with digital images or publish images on the
        internet that have had metadata removed or altered. You must not remove
        metadata information supplied in Images under any circumstances
        including without limitation from Images published online.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.3 When the work product for which the Images were licensed has been
        created or within 90 days, whichever is sooner, the Images, including
        any pre-press or pre-production copies, must be promptly deleted from
        your and any End User’s computer or other electronic storage systems.
      </p>
      <h3>7. CREDITS</h3>
      <p>
        7.1 Unless otherwise agreed, you must credit us and the photographer or
        other author of the Image whenever the Image is used in the form
        indicated in the credit field or, if there is no such indication, “©
        [photographer’s name]/[our name]”. If a credit line is omitted an
        additional fee equal to 50% of the original amount invoiced attributable
        to the Image in question shall be payable by you. Failure to provide a
        credit may also breach the photographer’s moral right to be identified
        under section 77 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 and
        equivalent laws in other jurisdictions.
      </p>
      <h3>8. PAYMENT</h3>
      <p>
        8.1 No reproduction of any Image is authorised until payment in full has
        been received by us. Any reproduction by you or the End User before
        payment in full has been received constitutes an infringement of
        copyright and a breach of this Agreement entitling us to terminate this
        Agreement immediately on written notice to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        8.2 Unless otherwise agreed by us in writing, all invoices are payable
        by you within 30 days. If you do not make full payment of an invoice on
        time we reserve the right to charge interest on the outstanding amount
        at the rate prescribed by the Late Payment of Commercial Debts
        &#40;Interest&#41; Act 1998 from the date payment was due until payment is made.
      </p>
      <p>
        8.3 All amounts due under this Agreement are exclusive of VAT which
        shall, where applicable, be paid by you at the prevailing rates on the
        due date for payment and on receipt of a VAT invoice from us.
      </p>
      <p>
        8.4 All payments to be made by you under this Agreement &#40;except any
        deduction or withholding which is required by law&#41; shall be paid free
        and clear of any deductions or withholdings for or on account of
        set-offs or counterclaims.
      </p>
      <h3>9. MODEL AND OTHER RELEASES; CAPTIONS AND OTHER INFORMATION</h3>
      <p>
        9.1 We give no warranties whatsoever as to the existence of any model,
        property or other releases associated with the Images.
      </p>
      <p>
        9.2 We give no warranties whatsoever as to the use of names, trade
        marks, logos, uniforms, registered or unregistered designs, artistic
        works or other material depicted in any Image which may be subject to
        intellectual property rights or other restrictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        9.3 You must satisfy yourself that all releases, consents, licences or
        permissions as may be required for use of the Images have been secured.
        You are solely responsible for obtaining all such releases, consents,
        licences or permissions and the Licence is conditional in each case on
        your obtaining them. You must not rely on any representation in this
        connection which may be made on our website and may only rely on an
        express representation given specifically to you by us in writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        9.4 We do not warrant the accuracy of the captioning, keywording or any
        other information associated with the Images. You must satisfy yourself
        that all such information is correct.
      </p>
      <h3>10. AUDIT</h3>
      <p>
        10.1 You shall keep separate and detailed records of all uses of the
        Images to enable us to verify your compliance with the terms of this
        Agreement. After giving written notice of 10 days, we, or any other
        person authorised by us, may inspect your records, premises and/or
        servers during normal business hours, and take away copies to verify the
        information provided by you. This right of inspection shall remain in
        effect for a period of one year after the expiry or termination of this
        Agreement.
      </p>
      <h3>11. INDEMNITY</h3>
      <p>
        11.1 You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless against any claims,
        damages, losses, expenses or costs &#40;including any direct, indirect or
        consequential losses, loss of profit and loss of reputation and all
        interest, penalties and legal costs and other expenses&#41; arising in any
        manner whatsoever from or as a result of your unauthorised use of any
        Image supplied by us to you, or any other breach by you of any of your
        obligations under this Agreement.
      </p>
      <h3>12. TERMINATION</h3>
      <p>
        12.1 We may &#40;by written notice to you&#41; terminate this Agreement
        immediately if:
      </p>
      <p>
        &#40;a&#41; you fail to pay any amount due under this Agreement in full within
        14 days of its due date and this failure is not remedied within 7 days
        of receipt of written notice to this effect; or
      </p>
      <p>
        &#40;b&#41; you commit any material breach of your obligations under this
        Agreement which is incapable of remedy, or if capable of remedy, is not
        remedied within 14 days of our giving written notice requiring the
        breach to be remedied; or
      </p>
      <p>
        &#40;c&#41; you cease, or threaten to cease, to carry on business, or any of the
        following events occur in respect of you or any of your holding
        companies:
      </p>
      <p style={{paddingLeft: "2rem"}}>
        &#40;i&#41; a proposal is made for a voluntary arrangement or for any other
        composition scheme or arrangement with or assignment for the benefit of
        creditors;
      </p>
      <p style={{paddingLeft: "2rem"}}>&#40;ii&#41; a resolution for winding-up is passed;</p>
      <p style={{paddingLeft: "2rem"}}>
        &#40;iii&#41; a petition for winding-up is presented, or an application is made
        for the appointment of a provisional liquidator, or a creditors’ meeting
        is convened;
      </p>
      <p style={{paddingLeft: "2rem"}}>
        &#40;iv&#41; a receiver, administrative receiver or similar officer is appointed
        over the whole or any part of your business or assets; or
      </p>
      <p style={{paddingLeft: "2rem"}}>
        &#40;v&#41; an application is made either for the appointment of an
        administrator or for an administration order.
      </p>
      <p>
        12.2 On any expiry or termination of this Agreement the Licence shall
        automatically terminate and there must be no further use of the Images.
        All Physical Images and any Image Carrier must be promptly returned to
        us and any other Digital Images must be promptly deleted from your and
        any End User’s computer or other electronic storage systems.
      </p>
      <h3>13. WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>

        copyright in the Images or any moral rights of the authors of the
        Images.
      </p>
      <p>
        13.2 Save where expressly provided, all terms which might be implied
        into this Agreement or any collateral contract, whether by statute,
        common law or otherwise, are hereby excluded to the maximum extent
        permitted by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        13.3 Nothing in this Agreement shall operate to exclude or limit our
        liability for &#40;a&#41; death or personal injury caused by our negligence; &#40;b&#41;
        any breach of the terms implied by section 12 of the Sale of Goods Act
        1979 or section 2 of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982; &#40;c&#41;
        fraud; or &#40;d&#41; any other liability which cannot be excluded or limited
        under applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        13.4 We shall have no liability for any losses or damages which may be

        the same are suffered directly or indirectly or are immediate or

      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>14. ASSIGNMENT</h3>
      <p>
        14.1 You shall not, without our prior written consent, assign, transfer

      <h3>15. COPYRIGHT AND PUBLICATION RIGHT</h3>
      <p>
        15.1 No interest in the copyright in any Image shall pass to you by

        with us by taking all steps required by us &#40;in our sole discretion&#41; in
        connection with any Infringement including, without limitation, where
        the Licence is exclusive, proceedings in our name or in the joint names

      <h3>16. MISCELLANEOUS TERMS</h3>
      <p>
        16.1 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
        and supersedes and extinguishes all previous agreements, arrangements
        and understandings between them, whether written or oral, relating to
        its subject matter. Each party agrees that it shall have no remedies in
        respect of any representation or warranty &#40;whether made innocently or

        writing and signed by the parties &#40;or their authorised representatives&#41;.
        If there is an inconsistency between any of the provisions of this

        and conditions or any other document, the provisions of this Agreement
        shall prevail.

      <p>
        16.3 If any court or competent authority finds that any provision of
        this Agreement &#40;or part of any provision&#41; is invalid, illegal or
        unenforceable, that provision or part-provision shall, to the extent
        required, be deemed to be deleted, and the validity and enforceability
        of the other provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected. If any
        invalid, unenforceable or illegal provision of this Agreement would be
        valid, enforceable and legal if some part of it were deleted, the
        provision shall apply with the minimum modification necessary to make it
        legal, valid and enforceable.
      </p>
      <p>
        16.4 No failure or delay by a party to exercise any right or remedy
        provided under this Agreement or by law shall constitute a waiver of
        that or any other right or remedy, nor shall it preclude or restrict the
        further exercise of that or any other right or remedy. No single or
        partial exercise of such right or remedy shall preclude or restrict the
        further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.
      </p>
      <p>
        16.5 This Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in
        connection with it or its subject matter or formation &#40;including
        non-contractual disputes or claims&#41; shall be governed by and construed
        in accordance with the law of England and Wales. The parties irrevocably
        agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive
        jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of or in
        connection with this Agreement or its subject matter or formation
        &#40;including non-contractual disputes or claims&#41;, save for infringement of
        copyright or non-payment of the Licence Fee where it shall be
        non-exclusive. However, if our business address is in Scotland or
        Northern Ireland then the words “Scotland” or “Northern Ireland”, as the
        case may be, shall be substituted for the words “England and Wales” in
        the preceding two sentences of this clause 16.5.
